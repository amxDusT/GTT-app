# Flutter App GTT for seeing stops and live map of busses

Started as a simple idea to just save my favorite stops.. now I'm trying to make it as much complete as I can.

Some of the features: 
- search by stop num and see busses passing in the stop (data from mato.muoversiatorino.it)
- save a stop to favorites
- add description to a stop in favorites
- map of a bus' stops and live busses (data from mapi.5t.torino.it)
- read GTT tickets/cards through NFC
- bus list and patterns
